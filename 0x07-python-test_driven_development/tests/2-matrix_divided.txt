``Divide a matrix`` module
==========================

Using ``matrix_divided``
------------------------

Importing the function
	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Testing code for a matrix and and integer
	>>> matrix = [
	... 	[1, 2, 3],
	... 	[4, 5, 6]
	... ]
	...
	>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Testing code when matrix is not list of lists
	>>> matrix_1 = [1, 2, 3]
	>>> try:
	... 	print(matrix_divided(matrix_1, 3))
	... except Exception as e:
	... 	print(e)
	matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Testing code when div is equal to 0
	>>> try:
	... 	print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
	... except Exception as e:
	... 	print(e)
	...
	division by zero

Testing code when div is not a number
	>>> try:
	... 	print(matrix_divided(matrix, "number"))
	... except Exception as e:
	... 	print(e)
	...
	div must be a number
